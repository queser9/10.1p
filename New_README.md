# Dockerizing a Web Application

This README documents the process of dockerizing a web application, including creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, using Docker Compose, and pushing the image to a registry.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

## Steps

1. Clone the web application repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root directory. The Dockerfile should include instructions to:
- Specify the base image
- Install dependencies
- Copy the application code
- Expose necessary ports
- Define the startup command

4. Build the Docker image
5. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory. The file should define the services, including the web application service, and specify the necessary configurations such as ports and volumes.

6. Start the Docker Compose environment


7. Push the Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub):
- Login to the registry:
  ```
  docker login
  ```
- Tag the image:
  ```
  docker tag <image-name> <registry-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
  ```
- Push the image:
  ```
  docker push <registry-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
  ```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can dockerize your web application, create a Docker image, use Docker Compose to define and run the application, and push the image to a registry for easy deployment and sharing.

For detailed instructions and code examples, refer to the relevant files in the project repository, such as the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
